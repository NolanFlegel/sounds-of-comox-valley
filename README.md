# sounds-of-comox-valley
This project captures the encroachment of urban development on wilderness areas. This is a Soundscape project where I've recorded and geocoded soundscapes in the Comox Valley.

Move around the map and click on the location pins to hear the soundscapes recorded at that location. What sounds of human activity can you hear in these natural areas?
